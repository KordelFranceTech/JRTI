# JRTI
JRTI - Just Read the Instructions: A free PDF reader iOS app for turning PDFs into audible files.
---
I built this so I could listen to new AI & robotics research papers on my commutes and got tired of paying for Speechify. 
It is a very minimalist app that loads a PDF and reads the content aloud.
There are some regex filters included to ensure artifacts such as headers, footers, and page numbers are not read aloud.
Speech pitch, speed, and other minor settings can also be set within the app.

I hope JRTI provides a baseline on which others can build their own customizations.
